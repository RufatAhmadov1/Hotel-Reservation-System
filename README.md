# Project Description: 
The Hotel Reservation System is a Python application that aims to create a
comprehensive system for managing hotel reservations. It enables hotel staff to efficiently
handle room availability, booking confirmations, and guest check-in/out processes.

# Features:
Room Availability: The system keeps track of the availability of rooms in the hotel. It allows staff
to view the status of each room, including whether it is vacant, reserved, or occupied.
Booking Management: The system handles the process of creating and managing reservations.
It enables staff to input reservation details, including guest information, check-in and check-out
dates, and room preferences.

Booking Confirmation: When a reservation is made, the system generates a booking
confirmation for the guest. It includes details such as reservation ID, check-in/out dates, room
type, and any additional services requested.
Guest Check-in/out: The system facilitates the smooth check-in and check-out of guests. It
handles the allocation of rooms, generates invoices, and updates the availability status of rooms
accordingly.

Room Management: The system allows staff to manage room information, including room types,
rates, and amenities. It enables the addition, modification, and deletion of rooms as per the
hotel's requirements.

Billing and Invoicing: The system generates invoices for guests, taking into account room
charges, additional services availed, and any applicable taxes. It provides accurate billing
information to facilitate smooth financial transactions.

# Functionality:
Room Availability Tracking: The system maintains a database or data structure to track the
availability of rooms. It allows staff to view room statuses, mark rooms as reserved or occupied,
and update availability as guests check out.

Reservation Management: The system enables staff to create new reservations by collecting
guest information, preferred room type, and check-in/out dates. It checks for room availability
and confirms the reservation.

Booking Confirmation Generation: Once a reservation is confirmed, the system generates a
booking confirmation that contains relevant details. It may generate a unique reservation ID for
future reference
